### Cinema Management System

This project is a simple console-based **Cinema Management System** developed in **C++**. It allows users to browse movies, check showtimes, book seats, and even purchase snacks and beverages. The system uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to manage different entities like movies, cinema, and food items.

### Features

* **View Movies and Showtimes:** Users can see a list of movies currently playing, along with their duration, showtimes, and available seats.
* **Ticket Booking:** The system facilitates booking seats for a chosen movie, with automatic calculation of the ticket price based on whether the movie is a premium showing.
* **Food and Beverages:** Users have the option to add snacks and beverages to their order from a predefined menu, with the total cost being updated accordingly.
* **Price Calculation:** The final cost for a booking is calculated by adding the ticket price and the cost of any purchased food items.
* **Simple Command-Line Interface:** The program provides a menu-driven interface for easy navigation.
* **OOP Design:** The code is structured using classes such as `Cinema`, `Movie`, `Item`, `Beverage`, and `Snack`, demonstrating concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.
